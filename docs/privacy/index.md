# Aerial Views Privacy Policy

Updated: August 2025

## 1. What information we collect

Aerial Views collects only fully anonymous usage data and crash reports. This includes:

* App performance metrics (such as launch events, errors, usage flow)

* Anonymous crash logs (no personal details)

* We do not collect names, emails, physical location, account data, or media content — only aggregated, anonymous information.

Here are the links to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app...

* [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
* [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics)
* [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/)

## 2. Why we collect this data

We use Firebase Analytics and crash reporting to:

* Help us understand how the app is used (eg. are some features unused? what are the most popular features?)

* Identify and fix crashes or bugs

* Improve features and reliability

No personal information is ever collected or linked to a real person or device.

## 3. Examples of data collected and why

1. We once saw a crash that only affected a specific device language. Including the device’s language and region (without any personal identifiers) helped us diagnose and fix the issue.

2. The weather feature uses a third‑party API with rate limits. We record anonymous request counts to ensure the app stays within those limits and to tune the frequency of weather updates in the future.

## 4. How your data is protected

Analytics and crash data is transmitted using industry-standard encryption (e.g., HTTPS)

No identifying data is collected or stored

Crash logs and event stats remain anonymous

## 5. Do we share your data?

We do not share your data with advertisers, marketers, or any third parties.

The information is used exclusively for improving Aerial Views.

## 6. Updates to this policy

If anything changes (e.g. new data collection is added), this page will be updated with the new effective date. We’ll also include a note in app release notes.

## 7. Contact & support
